# FOREWORD

The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8.

The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 7 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure-trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its Curricular Goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts.

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.

With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

# ABOUT THE BOOK

Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 7, is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage.

Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals:

CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports).   
CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events.   
CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding.   
CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature.   
CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression.   
CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246).

The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes such as learning together, wit and humour, dreams and discoveries, travel and adventure and homage to bravehearts have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated in all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, conversation or non-fiction.

There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc.

Unit 1—‘Learning Together’ encourages students to explore the interconnectedness of nature and human life. The story, ‘The Day the River Spoke’, emphasises the importance of respecting and listening to nature. The river encourages Jahnavi to overcome her fears and societal barriers by boldly pursuing her desire for education, assuring that her courage can make a difference. The poem, ‘Try Again’ inspires resilience and the power of perseverance, encouraging students to view challenges as stepping stones to success. The poem leaves a powerful impact on the readers, inspiring them to achieve their best goal in life. ‘Three Days to See’ presents a touching narrative of a girl who cannot see and that invites learners to appreciate their senses and value the beauty of the world around them.

Unit 2—‘Wit and Humour’ engages students with a light-hearted story, poem, and play. These delightful works showcase the charm of intelligence, humour and laughter. The amusing tale of ‘Animals, Birds, and Dr. Dolittle’ will help students explore the idea of a doctor who learns animal language. He not only communicates with animals but also treats their ailments with empathy. The story is a fable that entertains and also educates about animal care. The poem, ‘A Funny Man’ celebrates humour which can be unfamiliar that can spark curiosity and amusement. ‘Say the Right Thing’ highlights the comic consequences of miscommunication. The play focuses on the fact that it is important to say the right thing at the right time. We must listen carefully to what others are saying and we must think before we speak.

Unit 3—‘Dreams and Discoveries’ captures the essence of wonder and imagination of children. It also sparks curiosity and creativity, encouraging students to explore how dreams and discoveries shape the world. ‘My Brother’s Great Invention’ is a humorous story about a boy who likes to discover new things around him. This leads to an unexpected encounter with a thief. The story highlights determination, creativity, and sibling bonds, teaching students the value of trial and error in discovery. The poem ‘Paper Boats’ uses the imagery of paper boats to symbolise dreams and aspirations. Students will reflect on the joy of simple pleasures and the universal desire to connect with the unknown. ‘North, South, East, West’ will help students appreciate the diversity that exists in our country. The narrative presents postcards from a girl exploring India’s diverse landscapes with her parents. The vibrant observations will foster an appreciation for the country’s rich cultural and natural heritage.

Unit 4—‘Travel and Adventure’ ignites the spirit of exploration and aims to cultivate curiosity, resilience, and a sense of wonder. The story, ‘The Tunnel’ will take students on an adventurous episode in a tunnel, highlighting the excitement of discovery and the courage to face the unknown. It also conveys the concept of maturing through self-exploration. The poem, ‘Travel’ revolves around the theme of exploring the unknown and a strong desire to travel. Train is used as a symbol to embark on to new adventures with new people. The sun’s journey is used as a metaphor for constant movement and the human urge for exploration. ‘Conquering the Summit’ is a non-fiction piece on Arunima Sinha, the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest to accomplish her dream. This will inspire students with her extraordinary determination and perseverance.

Unit 5 — ‘Bravehearts’ instills a sense of patriotism and gratitude in students, celebrating the courage and sacrifices of the valiant who have selflessly laid down their lives for the nation. ‘A Homage to Our Brave Soldiers’ is a tribute to the real heroes of our nation—our soldiers, the embodiment of patriotism. The poem ‘My Dear Soldiers’ is a heartfelt acknowledgement of the courage, dedication, and sacrifice of the soldiers who tirelessly defend the nation, often in harsh and unforgiving conditions. The graphic story of ‘Rani Abbakka’ is a tale of a fearless queen, who defied Portuguese colonial powers with resilience and military acumen. She exhibited indomitable courage, valour, and determination.

These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development.

The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings such as―‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us write’ and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in meaningful discussions, and broaden their understanding. In-text activities and exercises at the end of each chapter are thoughtfully designed to be engaging, fostering joyful learning experiences while serving as tools for assessment as and for learning. Illustrations have been carefully crafted to depict context and enhance comprehension.

We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these activities, and develop language competencies.

# Poorvi

The textbook of English for Grade 7 is titled Poorvi after the Indian rāga ‘Poorvi’. This rāga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners.

Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between $3 { : } 0 0 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . and $6 { : } 0 0 \mathrm { p . m }$ . It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning.

shrieked: made a high-pitched sound

# I

A big bright tear splashed down her nose. And another. A kingfisher swept down, its wings an arrow of blue in the sunlight. And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge to bask in the sun.

“Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the matter?”

Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a soul in sight. She was rather scared and wanted to run away.

“You shouldn’t cry, you know,” the voice went on. “And you really shouldn’t be scared, when you have been coming here to see me every day, well, almost every day.”

She was puzzled. It was such a voice, like the river. It couldn’t be the river!

“Well, tell me all about it,” said the River, for it was the River. “I’ve got to hurry to reach the sea, you know.”

“They won’t let me go to school,” said Jahnavi. “I asked my mother, ‘Why can’t I go to school like Ettan and Meena?’ And Mother had replied, ‘You are too small, baby. Maybe later.’ ” But when she was five, little Ramu was born and Mother still said, “Maybe next year. Jahnavi, mind your little brother while I go to the fields.” Now, she was nearly ten and minding Little Appu, who was the smallest. “They don’t want me. They only...”—she stopped wi

![](images/2465933b69b5e2a970d3920a19abb68e043fd5508ad9444a087b36cda10dbc83.jpg)

“I am scared to go to school. And I’m so old now, they’ll never   
let me go. But I want to go. I want to learn to read like Ettan   
and Meena.” Jahnavi called her brother ‘Ettan’. Ettan means   
‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo trees rustle, why the moon always comes from behind the hills, never the other way, why the baby fish in the field water become frogs, why...”   
“Stop!” said the River. “You make me   
breathless. So many whys! I can tell   
you where the moon goes,” the River said conspiratorially. “It goes down towards the sea. I’ve seen; it always takes the same way—over the mountains and down to the sea, like me!”

rustle: light sound made by leaves rubbing against each other

rattling: noise made by shaking things

catamaran: a kind of boat wailed: (here) complained in a loud voice

“Even little Ramu goes to school,” said Jahnavi, “pity, the school isn’t by the sea,” said the River. “Then I could take you along, you know. But, I suppose I couldn’t really. You’d get your feet wet. And that would never do! I’m afraid there’s only one thing you can do.”

“Can I do something?” asked Jahnavi. “Well, it’s up to you,” said the River. “Seems to me little girls can do as much as little boys—they swim as fast as little boys. You just slip along one morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.”

“I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me! They’d chase me out.”

The River laughed. “You? Scared?” the River said, “when you’re not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River.

![](images/1f9cb35d064a2ca52e3d287d778e0996732ead75165cd7005e66cc9d27ad2794.jpg)

Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump.

“What are ships?” she asked.

“Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all night.”

Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked.

“I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know. Chandu’s catamaran is good enough for me. Chandu can take you to see a ship, someday.”

“They’d never let me!” wailed Jahnavi.

“Try going to school first,” said the River. “Remember—it’s up to you!”

Jahnavi gathered courage. The next day she reached the school, panting and out of breath and stood by the door listening while the teacher read out the lesson. It was a story about a prince called Asˊhoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor. Little Appu made no noise and she listened.

“Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And what is your name? You’re new in my class.”

“She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys. “It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice lad, Gopi.”

“If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you worry. We’ll find a way.”

![](images/1232b042f6b817387fe64732b4287b98c40a8e9a6995c130e2206c1e698444fd.jpg)

Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want. When I was your age, I wanted to go to school, but your grandmother said ‘No’, but now, I am glad the teacher came to talk to your father.”

![](images/d45ce3ec2f02d86d1b56b6ad479bc243367a5f240e2e4fe1fef6e20b2b107468.jpg)

And Jahnavi said, “Mother, when I grow up, I’ll be a teacher and I’ll go from house to house in our village and ask all the little girls to come to my school. And I’ll teach them all that I’m going to learn.”

And she went down the path between the fields the next morning before school began, to meet the River. “I did it!” she told the River. “I was scared, but I did it! And they’re letting me go. I’m going to learn to write my name and do sums and find out why our little fishes in the rice fields turn into frogs.” She heard the river’s sleepy chuckle, “Come again, little girl, and I’ll tell you all about the ships that sail the sea.”

# Let us read

King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down In a lonely mood to think;

‘Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown, But his heart was beginning to sink.

For he had been trying to do a great deed, To make his people glad; He had tried and tried, but couldn’t succeed And so he became quite sad.

He flung himself down in low despair, As grieved as man could be; And after a while he pondered there, “I’ll give it all up,” said he.

Now just at that moment a spider dropped,   
With its silken, filmy clue;   
And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped To see what the spider would do.

‘Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome, And it hung by a rope so fine; That how it would get to its cobweb home, King Bruce could not divine.

![](images/24d4ce99656f105e8dabfdd664e8c400aaa6507a966ebae4b42b2ebbde2a0348.jpg)

It soon began to cling and crawl Straight up with strong endeavour; But down it came with a slippery sprawl, As near to the ground as ever.

Up, up it ran, not a second to stay, To utter the least complaint; Till it fell still lower, and there it lay, A little dizzy and faint.

Its head grew steady — again it went, And travelled a half-yard higher; ‘Twas a delicate thread it had to tread, And a road where its feet would tire.

Again it fell and swung below, But again it quickly mounted; Till up and down, now fast, now slow, Nine brave attempts were counted.

“Sure,” cried the King, “that foolish thing Will strive no more to climb; When it toils so hard to reach and cling, And tumbles every time.”

But up the insect went once more, Ah me! ‘tis an anxious minute; He’s only a foot from his cobweb door, Oh say, will he lose or win it?

Steadily, steadily, inch by inch, Higher and higher he got; And a bold little run at the very last pinch Put him into his native cot.

“Bravo, bravo!” the King cried out, “All honour to those who try; The spider up there, defied despair; He conquered, and why shouldn’t I?”

And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind, And gossips tell the tale,   
That he tried once more as he tried before, And that time did not fail.

# Let us discuss

I Complete the summary of the poem by filling in the blanks with suitable words from the text given in the box below. Share your answers with the teacher. An example has been given.

# Let us explore

I Collect folk songs in your own language that connect us with nature and compile them as a class project.

II Did you know that spiders are not insects? They belong to a group called the arachnids. Observe a spider and an ant from a distance and note down the differences between them. Share your observations with your classmates. Ask your Science teacher for more information to know about spiders better.

III Let us learn how to weave a spider web.

1. Take three sticks (each about eight inches long) and a roll of old wool.

2. Tie the sticks together in the centre with the wool (Fig. 1).

3. Start weaving the web by putting a loop around every stick (Figs. 2 and 3).

4. Complete the web and tie the thread in a knot on the stick where the web is complete (Fig. 4).

Now, decorate it with words and phrases you learnt about the spider in the poem or anything else that you like.

# Thr ee Days to See

# Let us do these activities before we read.

I Work in pairs. Recall a visit to a place that you liked. Discuss the details of that place and write about the following:

1. Name of the place

2. The person(s) you went with

3. The things that you could:

• see • listen • smell • taste • touch and feel

II How does this memory make you feel?

III Do you think your visit/experience would be different if you could not see or hear? Share your answers with your classmates and the teacher.

Did you know that our five senses are essential for us to experience and make sense of the world around us?

I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening Nature after her winter’s sleep. Occasionally, I am very fortunate; I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.

At times, my heart cries out with longing to see all these things. If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And I have imagined what I should most like to see if I were given the use of my eyes, say, for just three days.

I should divide the period into three parts. On the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and companionship have made my life worth living. I do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that ‘window of the soul’, the eye.

I can only ‘see’ through my fingertips the outline of a face.   
I can detect laughter, sorrow and other obvious emotions.   
I know my friends from the feel of their faces.

birch: a slender tree with thin peeling bark

I should behold with awe the magnificent panorama of light with which the sun awakens the sleeping earth. This day I should devote to a hasty glimpse of the world, past and present. I should want to see the pageant of man’s progress, and so I should go to the museums. There my eyes would see the condensed history of the earth—animals and the races of men pictured in their native environment; gigantic   
carcasses of dinosaurs and mastodons that roamed   
the earth before man appeared, with his   
tiny stature and powerful brain, to   
conquer the animal kingdom.

The following morning, I should again greet the dawn, anxious to discover new delights, new revelations of beauty. Today, this third day, I shall spend in the workaday world, amid the haunts of men going about the business of life. The city becomes my destination.

First, I stand at a busy corner, merely looking at people, trying by sight of them to understand something of their daily lives. I see smiles, and I am happy. I see serious determination, and I am proud. I see suffering, and I am compassionate.

At midnight, permanent night would close in on me again. Naturally in those three short days I should not have seen all I wanted to see. Only when darkness had again descended upon me should I realise how much I had left unseen.

I who am blind can give one hint to those who can see: use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to your other senses. Hear the music of voice, the song of a bird, the mighty strains of an orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the most of every sense; glory in all the facets of pleasure and beauty, which the world reveals to you through the several means of contact, which Nature provides. But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.

# Let us learn

I Sensory words are descriptive—they describe how we experience the world: how we see, hear, smell, taste or feel something.

Complete the following table with sensory words from the text in Column 2 for the five senses in Column 1. Add new words in Column 3.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Column 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Column 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Column 3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>What you see</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>panorama</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>What you hear</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>music</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>What you smell</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>perfume</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>What you taste</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>relish</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>What you feel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>rough</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr></table>

II Read the following sentences from the text and underline the verbs.

• I should divide the period into three parts. • On the first day, I should want to see • The next day I should arise with the dawn… • I should behold with awe…

The words you have underlined are a combination of two verbs. In each of these sentences, ‘should’ is the modal verb (suggestion), and the second verb (divide, want, arise, behold) is the main verb.

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability. They are used before the main verb to give additional information about the function of the main verb. Common modal verbs include can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must, and ought to.

III Identify the modal verbs in the following sentences. Choose the functions they express from those given in the box below.

possibility necessity polite request ability moral obligation

1. You can learn a lot from this experience.

2. They might arrive late due to traffic.

3. She must finish her homework before dinner.

4. They ought to apologise for their mistake.

5. He would like to have some lassi, please.

I Do you know how persons with visual challenges are able to read and write? They read through touch with the help of Braille, a code of raised dots that represents the letters of the alphabet. This tactile code was developed over a period of nine years by Louis Braille, who became blind at a very young age due to an accident.

# Let us listen (refer to page 12)

I Read the words given in the box below. You will listen to five people speak about school life. As you listen, circle the words that are used by the speakers. There are two words you do not need.

Speaker (i): (Father) Should girls attend school? Yes, they should. I do my best to ensure that both my son and daughter get equal opportunities. I look forward to their successful careers and rewarding lives. I feel education gives freedom to make choices in life. Whether my daughter wants to work in an organisation or be a homemaker, it should be her choice and the same applies to my son.

Speaker (ii): (Grandmother) I went to school but many girls at that time could not attend school because some elders in the village felt that girls should help in the house and take care of their little brothers and sisters. I am happy that the situation has changed today.

Speaker (iii):(Teacher) The school prepares students for meaningful and useful participation in the world of work by learning hands-on abilities and skills, developing equal respect for head-hands-heart, valuing the dignity of labour, and understanding vocational choices for the future.

Speaker (iv): (Student) I like to go to school. I feel that by coming to school and reading the books, I learn about things from all over the world. I also have friends with whom I can share my feelings.

Speaker (v): (Principal) Everyone should attend school. You must’ve noticed that the girls are doing very well. However, as the Head of an institution, I know that all students can work hard. My message to students is that they should attend school regularly and take part in every school activity without bothering whether it is for girls or boys. The idea is to focus on learning.

II You will once again listen to the five speakers. As you listen, match each statement 1–7 to each speaker (i)–(v). There are two statements that you do not need.

# Let us listen (refer to page 24)

1. You will listen to a story about an ant. Read the questions given below and before you listen, guess the answers to these questions.

Hello everyone,

I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let me share another story with you.

In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day, the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to carry alone.

“This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My family will be so happy!” she thought to herself.

She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy. She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and began to cry.

As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying, over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong nest.

“If that bird can keep trying and succeed, then I shouldn’t give up either,” she thought, feeling inspired.

Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together, they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the anthill.

“We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted, excited and grateful.

She and her friends celebrated their success.

We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.

Hope you all liked the story.

Thank you!

2. Now, listen to the story once again and as you listen, check whether your answers are correct. Rectify wherever needed.

# Thr ee Days to See

# Let us listen (refer to page 36)

You will listen to a conversation between a mother and son. As you listen, select four true statements from 1–7 given below.

Anu j : Ma, we have a new student in our class, Tara. She’s quite talkative and pleasant. You know, the writing in her books doesn’t look like ours. It’s different. She told us that it’s called Braille.

Mother : It’s great to know that your school has facilities to address the needs of the visually impaired. Thanks to the Digital India Initiative, which is paving the way for inclusion of the visually impaired.

Anu j : Oh, Digital India! That’s about being computer literate, isn’t it?

Mother : Well, Digital India is about more than just internet access. It aims to include everyone, including people with disabilities, by providing digital infrastructure and services. For the visually impaired, it means access to assistive technologies like screen readers, voice-overenabled smartphones and apps that can make daily activities easier.

Anu j : Ohh... interesting. What is a screen reader, Ma?

Mother : I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a software application that helps people who are visually impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out the text displayed on the screen and provides audio feedback.

Anu j : That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like we do?

Mother : Yes, she can.

Anu j : So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives.

Mother : It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually impaired can use digital services independently, without help from others. This can improve their quality of life. It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT, banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently like anybody else.

Anu j : Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired can work and do things on their own? I’m so proud of my school.

Mother : Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of Digital India reach everyone, helping them to participate fully in all areas of life.

Remember, inclusion is not just about having the right tools, but also about having the right mindset.

I Do you have a pet or a domestic animal? If yes, why? If not, why not? How do people usually spend time with a pet or domestic animal? Share your thoughts with your classmates and the teacher.

II You must have read stories where animals and birds talk. If you had a chance to communicate with an animal or a bird, who would you like to speak to and why? Share your thoughts with your classmates and the teacher.

III If we closely observe the body language of animals and birds, we can understand what they want to tell us. Work in pairs and study the pictures given below. Find out what emotions these animals and birds are trying to convey. Share your observations with your classmates and the teacher.

Doctor Dolittle was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat’sfood-Man who had come to see him with a stomach-ache.

“Why don’t you give up being a people’s doctor, and be an animal doctor?” asked the Cat’s-food-Man.

The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.

“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all about animals—much more than what these vets here do. That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—my wife, Theodosia, is a scholar, and she read your book to me. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think.”

When the Cat’s-food-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said, “That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal doctor. Give the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead— they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal doctor.”

“Oh, there are plenty of animal doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flowerpots outside on the windowsill to get the rain.

“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”

“I knew that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.

“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages—people’s language and bird language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker’, you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oiee, fee-fee?”

cracker: a thin, dry biscuit usually eaten with cheese

“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”

“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’—in bird language.”

“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”

“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”

“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the drawer and came back with a book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new. Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.”

So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one   
another. And all that afternoon, while it was   
raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table   
giving him bird words to put down in the   
book.

At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in, the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s talking to you.”

“Looks to me as though he were scratching his ear,” said the Doctor.

![](images/b4ab5abbfbfde75d4aac60e16f010b461aaaabc0f95ae506df31efb37a18945c.jpg)  
Birds’ A.B.C.: (here) the language that birds speak

“But animals don’t always speak with their mouths,” said the parrot in a high voice, raising her eyebrows. “They talk with their ears, with their feet, with their tails—with everything. Sometimes they don’t want to make a noise. Do you see now the way he’s twitching up one side of his nose?”

“What’s that mean?” asked the Doctor.

“That means, ‘Can’t you see that it has stopped raining?’” Polynesia answered. “He is asking you a question. Dogs nearly always use their noses for asking questions.”

After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.

# Let us discuss

I Complete the following sentence by selecting a suitable reason.

The Cat’s-food-Man suggests to Doctor Dolittle that he should become an animal doctor because he believes that Dolittle

1. earns less fee by treating human patients   
2. enjoys the company of animals as they speak less

III Do you think Doctor Dolittle would be famous as an animal doctor? If yes, why? If not, why not?

# II

As soon as the Cat’s-food-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal doctor, old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.

One day a plough horse was brought to him; and the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language.

“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now—for something or the other. What I need is spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him, but he couldn’t understand a word of horse language. What I need is spectacles.”

“Of course—of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”

“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse—“only green. They’ll keep the Sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the field.”

“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”

“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out—“the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals—just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor.”

“Well, well!” said the Doctor.

“When will my glasses be ready?”

“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”

countryside: rural area

Then John Dolittle got a fine, big pair of green spectacles; and the plough horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see as well as ever.

And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals wearing glasses in the countryside, round Puddleby; and a blind horse was a thing unknown.

And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to him. As soon as they found that he could talk their language, they told him where the pain was and how they felt, and of course it was easy for him to cure them.

Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big garden who really was a doctor. And whenever any creatures got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs—but all the little things of the fields, like harvest mice, badgers, and bats, all came at once to his house on the edge of the town, so that his big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to get in to see him.

There were so many that came that he had to have special doors made for the different kinds. He wrote ‘HORSES’ over the front door, ‘COWS’ over the side door, and ‘SHEEP’ on the kitchen door. Each kind of animal had a separate door—even the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar, where they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come round to them.

And so, in a few years’ time, every living thing for miles and miles got to know about John Dolittle, M.D. And the birds who flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign lands about Dolittle who could understand their talk and help them in their troubles. In this way he became famous among the animals—all over the world. He was happy and liked his life very much.

One day a funny kind of man Came walking down this street He wore a shoe upon his head And hats upon his feet.

He raised the shoe and smiled at me, His manners were polite; But never had I seen before Such a funny sounding sight.

He said, “Allow me to present Your Highness with a rose.” And taking out a currant bun He held it to my nose.

I staggered back against the wall And then I answered, “Well! I never saw a rose with such A funny looking smell.”

He then began to sing a song, And sat down on the ground; You never heard in all your life Such a funny feeling sound.

“My friend, why do you wear two hats Upon your feet?” I said. He turned the other way about, And hopped home on his head.

# Let us explore

I In ancient Indian literature and mythology, there are several humorous or funny characters who play important roles in the stories. These characters often represent wit, humour and mischief while conveying deeper moral lessons. Here are a few well-known funny characters:

Tenali Rama Birbal Mullah Nasruddin King Vikramaditya and Betal

Take any story to read and share it with your classmates and the teacher.

II We can identify the acts of the funny man with certain modernday activities that have playfulness, or unconventional behaviour. For example:

Street Perf ormers or Clowns: Like the funny man in the poem, modernday street performers or clowns often dress in unusual ways and do unexpected acts to entertain people.

Perf orma nc e Art or Ab strac t Thea tre: The funny man’s actions, such as singing a song and hopping on his head, resemble performance art or abstract theatre, where artists break conventional rules to create thought-provoking, often humorous experiences.

Children’s Enterta inment a nd Comedy Shows: The funny man’s behaviour is reflected in children’s shows to evoke laughter.

In these examples, the common theme is humour, imagination, and defying logic or expectation, which is exactly what the funny man in the poem represents.

III Sukumar Ray, an Indian poet and illustrator, wrote poems in a similar style in his book Abol Tabol.

You may also share a similar poem from your native language with your classmates and the teacher.

IV Read and enjoy the poem.

# My Lost Penc il

Oh pencil, dear pencil, where have you gone? I just had you here a minute at dawn! You were sharp and perfect, ready to write, Now you’re missing—gone from sight!

Did you roll off my desk? Did you fall to the floor? Did someone swipe you for sure? It’s always the same, I’ve lost fifty this year, By the end of the month, they just disappear!

Next time, I’ll tie you with tape or a string, Because losing my pencils is a real thing.

# Characters

Mary Sh aw : a young girl   
Mrs . Sh aw : Mary’s mother   
Mrs . Harding : the wife of Mr. Harding, a wealthy man   
Mrs . Lee : Mr. Harding’s married sister

hilariously: in a very funny way

blunders: careless mistakes

# embarrasses:

# Scene I

Mrs . Sh aw : The room looks cleaner now. Put that coat away in your bedroom. This room isn’t the place for coats.

Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee will soon be here, and they don’t want to see that.

Mary : You’re always telling me to put things away.

Mrs . Sh aw : Yes, I am. You leave your clothes all over the house.

Mary : I’m not a child!

Mrs . Sh aw : No, you’re not. So please keep your clothes in your own room.

Mary : Why are those two women coming here? Who’s Mrs. Harding?

Mrs . Sh aw : She’s the wife of a wealthy man, Mr. Harding. He has just bought a big house in Lanfield. They lived in London before. She’s coming to have a talk. I met her in a shop and asked her to come.

Mary : Oh, I’ve seen her children. They often come along the road. Who’s Mrs. Lee?

Mrs . Sh aw : She’s Mr. Harding’s sister. She has been staying with them for a while.

Mary : What are you going to talk about?

Mrs . Sh aw : I don’t know. All kinds of things. One day you’ll have to go to some of these houses yourself and talk to the people there.

Mary : I can talk now. I’ve been able to talk for a long time.

Mrs . Sh aw : Yes, that’s true. You always talk too much. But does anyone want to hear the things that you say?

Mary I can talk very well when I like. I’ll stay with you today and talk to them when they come.

Mrs . Sh aw : Oh, I don’t think so. You can go out for a walk. It will be better if you do that.

Mary : Why?

Mrs . Sh aw : If you stay with me, you may not say the right thing.

Mary : I know the right things to say: “Good afternoon”, “How are you?” and things like that. Let me stay today. I can do it very well. I’ll show you. Anyone can talk.

Mrs . Sh aw : You may stay if you like. But take care. I want to know Mrs. Harding well. I want her to ask me to go to their house. There isn’t much to do here in Lanfield, and I want to know some more people. I want some more friends here. So take care when you say anything.

Mary : Tell me what to say.

Mrs . Sh aw : I can’t tell you everything, but you’ll always be right if you’re kind to people. Say things that will please them. Then they’ll like you. Laugh a lot, and try to make them laugh too. And if everyone stops talking, say something to make them talk again. They don’t want to sit here and look at the floor without speaking. Think of something to say.

![](images/0b0044e8d9f945c55b6c9087ca4b85e535ca56c933a22ece0f3671e1205267fd.jpg)

Mary : I can do that. There’s always something to say. Must I do anything else?

Mrs . Sh aw : When they are ready to leave, don’t jump out of your chair and look gladly at the door. You must look sorry when they want to leave.

Mary : What shall I do when they want to go?

Mrs . Sh aw : Ask them to stay a little while longer. Just say, “Must you go? Can’t you stay?” or something like that. You like them and you want them to stay, and you must let them understand that.

Mary : That’s not very hard, is it? I’ll remember that. “Must you go? Can’t you stay? Must you go? Can’t you stay?”

Mrs . Sh aw : That’s right. Now take your coat to your room and change into a clean dress. You must look nice when they come. And if everyone stops talking, say something kind to make them talk again. And don’t say anything that will make them angry.

Mary : I will remember. I’ve often done harder things than this.

![](images/7d5cc7975f1a1c9753e868920595aac1c8eafb38e28d0ecafb3b4aeba6ce436b.jpg)

Mrs . Sh aw : So you like Lanfield, Mrs. Harding! I’m very glad.

Mrs . Harding : Yes, we like it very much. It’s not the same as London, but there are some very nice people here, and we’ve found a good house. (No one says anything more, and Mrs. Shaw looks at Mary.)

Mary : What beautiful children you have, Mrs. Harding! I’ve often seen them walking along the road.

Mrs . Harding : Oh, I haven’t any children.

Mary : Oh, yes, you have! I’ve seen them: a little boy and a little girl.

Mrs . Harding : (not very pleased) I have no children; believe me.

Mary : Oh!

Mrs . Sh aw : (quietly) They must be someone else’s children. Have you met Mr. Best? He’s a nice man. He lives near you.

Mary : Oh, Mr. Best! He lives here and he works in London. He goes all the way to London by train every morning, and then he comes all the way back by train every night. He lives in trains! (she laughs) What kind of life is that? Why do people do things like that? They do not know how to live. And he reads two newspapers in the train every day. He never reads a book. But he’s only a banker, and bankers can’t think.

Mrs . Lee : My brother’s a banker. He goes to London by train every morning and comes back every night. He reads two newspapers in the train in the morning, and another every night.

Mary : Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

Mrs . Sh aw Bankers always have to read a lot of newspapers. Do you know Mrs. Best? She’s a nice woman. I like her.

: But have you seen her clothes? She goes out in a blue dress with a red coat over it. (she laughs)

Mrs . Harding : I have a blue dress, and I often put on my red coat at the same time.

Mrs . Sh aw : (quickly) I like blue dresses and red coats. (No one says anything.)

Mary

: I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon. I met her in the street. No one sees her in the morning because she always stays in bed then. And she’s always asking the doctor to go to see her. I can’t understand women who stay in bed in the morning. And why must she always ask for the doctor? I’ve never been to a doctor in my life.

Mrs . Harding : I stay in bed in the morning myself.

Mrs . Lee : I often go to the doctor.

Mary : Oh, I’m sorry. (No one speaks.)

Mrs . Sh aw :

Do you know Mrs. Grantley? She’s one of my best friends.

Mary : But she’s so talkative! Talkative women aren’t very interesting, are they?

Mrs . Lee : My mother’s a very talkative woman.

Mary : Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know. (No one says anything.)

Mary : (looking out of the window): Oh, there’s that dog again! It always looks very dirty. I don’t like dogs, do you? Who wants a dog? That dog’s always near our house. Why do people keep dogs? Who wants a dog? Why doesn’t its owner keep it clean? Have you seen it?

![](images/cd4770f8382ef375f7fa4bce914feee988cdebd976fd7ecbc5a04529de7b022b.jpg)

Mrs . Harding : (looking out of the window) Yes, I’ve seen it. That’s Towzer. It’s our dog.

: (with a red face) Oh, I didn’t know! (No one speaks.)

: (still looking out of the window) There’s Mr. Pomeroy on his horse. He’s always talking about horses. He rides a horse every day, and practises shooting. Why must he do that? What have they done to Mr. Pomeroy? Why do some men like horses more than they like people? It’s hard to understand men.

Mrs . Lee : My brother practises shooting when he has the time, and he rides his horse when he can. He sold his house in London and bought a house here because he wanted to ride and practise shooting.

Mrs . Harding : (looking at Mrs. Lee) It’s getting a little late. We must go now, Mrs. Shaw. It has been very nice to have a little talk. (She looks at Mary.)

Mrs . Lee : Very nice. (She looks at Mary.)

Mrs . Sh aw : It was very good of you to come to see us. Please stay a little longer.

Mary

: (unable to say the right thing even now) Oh, must you stay? Can’t you go?

# Let us learn

I Study the following words taken from the text.

humorous, hilariously, coming, beautiful

The given words are made by adding word endings like -ous, -ly, -ing, and -ful to the root words humour, hilarious, come, and beauty. Such word endings are called suffixes.

$$
\begin{array} { l l l } { { \bullet { \ h u m o u r } } } & { { + } } & { { - O u s } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { \bullet { \ h i l a r i o u s } } } & { { + } } & { { - l y } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { \bullet { \ c o m e } } } & { { + } } & { { - i n g } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { \bullet { \ b e a u t y } } } & { { + } } & { { - f u l } } \end{array}

# Let us listen

I Mrs. Shaw wanted Mary to learn to say the right thing. You will listen to a conversation between a mother and her son about basic manners. As you listen, fill in the blanks given below by selecting the correct option. (Transcript for the teacher on pg. 89 )

1. How did the son behave in the grocery queue?

(i) strangely (ii) impatiently (iii) politely

2. The mother finally refers to her son as a (i) polite young man (ii) responsible son (iii) grateful person

II You will once again listen to the conversation. As you listen, select four true statements from 1– 7 given below.

1. The mother uses the grocery store incident as an opportunity to teach her son about patience and fairness.   
2. The son recognises the value of apologising and understands that it shows he notices others.   
3. The son is gradually learning the importance of polite words and actions from his mother’s guidance.   
4. The mother discourages her son from speaking softly in public, suggesting that people should adjust to his voice level.   
5. The son feels that covering his mouth when coughing is only important when he’s at home.   
6. The son receives all advice readily while understanding its importance.   
7. The mother uses praise to support the polite behaviours she wants her son to continue practising.

# Let us speak

As you know

• Intonation is the rise and fall of the pitch of tone while speaking.

Let us learn about sentence stress.

• Sentence stress is laying emphasis on certain word(s) in a sentence. The emphasis on particular words helps to convey the meaning and importance of the sentence.

Content words like book, run, beautiful, quickly, etc., are mostly stressed instead of function words like she, in, is, etc., in a sentence.

I Speak the given declarative sentence aloud.

![](images/8497b36e84918637f8961eb156678ffa1ad4e9db903b2f96361654312815f6ee.jpg)

I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.

• Use falling intonation towards end of the sentence as declarative sentences usually have falling intonation.   
• Stress the words ‘Mrs. Cotter’.

Remember, stress does not mean to say the word louder than others. It means to say a word with more emphasis than others.

II Speak the following declarative sentences with falling intonation and stress the highlighted words.

1. The room looks cleaner now. 2. You always talk too much.

3. You leave your clothes all over the house.

III Work in pairs and speak the following sentences 1–5 aloud, as Mary. Apply stress and falling intonation. Match each of the sentences to the meaning they convey in (i)–(v).

(i) I might have done other things but did not hurt anyone.   
(ii) I might cause hurt usually, but not anyone on this day.   
(iii) The action of hurting anyone did not occur.   
(iv) I, specifically, did not hurt anyone, possibly implying someone else might have.   
(v) I may have spoken a lot many things but not a single person was hurt.

IV Now, speak the given declarative sentence with rising intonation towards the end of sentence and stress the highlighted words.

I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.

The rising intonation makes it sound like a question. It asks whether I was the person who actually saw Mrs. Cotter: Did I see Mrs. Cotter this afternoon?

# Remember

The way we use stress and intonation in a sentence can change the meaning of what we wish to say if we are not careful.

# Let us write

Rewrite the play ‘Say the Right Thing’ as a short story, focusing on Mary’s interactions with her mother and the guests.

• Ensure the story captures the main events, character emotions, and humorous moments effectively.   
• Use paragraphs to organise your story and include descriptive language   
to bring the characters and events to life.

You may refer to the following hints:

• Begin with an introduction: describe Mary and Mrs. Shaw, their relationship and the setting of the story.   
Explain Mrs. Shaw’s instructions to Mary before the guests arrive and Mary’s confidence in handling the situation.   
• Narrate the events when Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee visit, highlighting Mary’s remarks and the guests’ reactions.   
• Include key moments of humour and awkwardness to maintain the tone   
of the play.   
• Conclude by commenting on how the visit ended and Mary’s impact on   
the situation.

# Let us explore

I Work in groups. Enact your favourite part of the play.

Points to remember:

• Allot a specific role to each member in the group. For example: director, narrator, and characters • Include the actions and expressions as indicated in brackets in the play.

II Find out how people greet guests who visit their homes in different languages. Share it with your classmates and the teacher.

III ‘Vasudhaiva Kuṭumbakaṁ’ (olq/So dq VqEcde) is a

Sanskrit phrase which means the world is one family. Vasudha (olq/k) means Earth; eva (,o) translates to ‘is thus’ and Kuṭumbakaṁ (dq VqEcde) means ‘family’. The phrase originates from ancient Indian texts like the Maha Upanishad and the Hitopadesha.

This saying highlights the interconnectedness of all people, suggesting that humanity is part of a single global family. It encourages unity, cooperation, and treating others with kindness and empathy, regardless of differences in nationality, race, or religion. The message is often used to promote global peace and mutual understanding among diverse cultures and nations. ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ was chosen as the theme for the G20 Summit which captured the essence of global unity, common bonds, and shared aspirations for a better future.

# Let us listen (refer to page 65)

You will listen to a girl narrate a personal incident. As you listen, select the picture related to the narration.

Hello. This is quite a funny incident. One day, I was so preoccupied with preparing for my presentation. After a long day of studying at a friend’s place, I finally came home. Exhausted, I removed my shoes at the door and headed straight to the kitchen for some lunch. I served myself dal-chawal and ate it, still thinking about all the topics I needed to cover.

Once I finished my lunch, I got up to put my shoes away in my room and placed my plate in the kitchen. However, being so preoccupied, I ended up doing the opposite! I walked to my room with my plate in hand and left it on my desk. Then, I took my shoes and placed them in the kitchen!

As I stood there, confused, I realised what I had done. I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. I shook my head, recovered my shoes from the kitchen and kept the plate in the kitchen.

II You will once again listen to the girl narrate a personal incident. As you listen, arrange the events in order of occurrence.

# Sa y the Right Thing

# Let us listen (refer to page 84)

I Mrs. Shaw wanted Mary to learn to say the right thing. You will listen to a conversation between a mother and a son about basic manners. As you listen, fill in the blanks given below by selecting the correct option.

Mother : Why were you getting impatient in the grocery store?

Son : Was I really? I just didn’t like waiting so long.

Mother : I know waiting can be boring, but remember, we always stand in queues and wait for our turn. It’s fair for everyone, right?

Son : Hmm, I guess. Even if it takes a lot of time?

Mother : Well, that’s when we practise patience. And when it’s our turn, what do we say to the shopkeeper?

Son : We say, ‘Thank you’. And ‘Please’ if we ask for something, right?

Mother : Yes! Those are polite words. Why do you think they’re important?

Son : Maybe because they make people feel respected?

Mother : Exactly! It shows gratitude and kindness. And what about yesterday when you bumped into that lady with the blue sari?   
Son : Oh, I said sorry right away. You always tell me it’s important to apologise.   
Mother : That’s true. Why do you think it’s important to apologise?   
Son : Um… so people know I didn’t mean to do it and that I care?   
Mother : Yes, it shows you’re responsible. And how about when we’re in places like the library? What kind of voice should we use?   
Son : Oh, I know this! We speak softly so we don’t bother others.   
Mother : Right again! It’s called using an ‘inside voice’.   
Son : I know. I also know that we should cover our mouth when we yawn, sneeze or cough in a gathering or a public place.   
Mother : Absolutely! You’re getting really good at remembering these things. And when we talk at home or school, what should we do when someone else is speaking?   
Son : We wait for our turn. It’s not well-mannered to interrupt.   
Mother : You’ve got it, Rohan. You’re becoming a really polite young man.   
Son : Thanks, Ma. So, do you think I’ll be ready to handle the grocery queue next time?   
Mother : Certainly! And maybe we can get some ice cream as a reward if you do it well.   
Son : Deal! And… thank you!

II You will once again listen to the conversation. As you listen, select four true statements from 1–7 given below.

“Who put that water bag here?” roared my father from the front doorstep. “Your burglar alarm,” I hissed to my brother Anand, who was getting ready to disappear from the house. Ma rushed in to see what the racket was all about and found Papa standing there, sopping wet and scowling.

“I want to know who is behind this nonsense,” Papa said grimly.

“I think it’s supposed to be a burglar alarm,” Ma said, in a soothing voice.

“I don’t care what it’s supposed to be,” Papa said.

“Where’s that boy? I’m sure he rigged this up.”

Anand had vanished by this time and reappeared only after dinner when Papa had cooled down.

Before this story, let me put you in the picture. I am Anita, fourteen years old. My brother Anand, one year younger than me, caused all that hoo-ha with his burglar alarm.

And this is not the first time he’s got on Papa’s nerves or frightened someone half to death in the house. The trouble with him is that he thinks he is a scientist. He loves tinkering with all sorts of electrical gadgets, tools, dynamos, planks of wood, and things like that. And he keeps creating ‘inventions’ that never work out as they are supposed to.

Recently there had been a rush of thefts in the colony and Anand had got it into his head that what was needed was a burglar alarm. So, the minute Papa left for the office and Ma for the market, he started on his latest scheme. As usual I had to be involved, though I’d have preferred to finish my novel. “If you get a shelling, don’t bring me in,” I warned Anand.

“Nothing will go wrong this time. I’ve planned it out carefully. See the blueprint.”

Anand loves words like blueprint—it makes him feel professional! Anyway, I looked at the elaborate drawing of doors, wires, and bells and asked, “How does this thing work?”

“It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens, this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging sound. Then this water bag here is loosened and falls on the thief’s head. By then we call the police—simple!”

“But how does the alarm know that a burglar is opening the door?”

“I’ve taken care of that,” Anand said loftily. I had my own doubts about the alarm’s guessing powers, but kept them to myself because when Anand is in one of his inventive moods, nothing stops him.

“You see,” Anand explained smugly, “A thief tries to open the door stealthily. I’ve rigged it up so that the alarm works only when the door is opened gently.”

I was sceptical. “Remember, if Papa asks, I’m not involved,” I warned. “Now clean up this mess before anyone gets home.”

As you already know, my doubts about the alarm were quite justified. Papa, who always opens the door softly, was thoroughly soaked and angry as angry could be. Anyway, for a week after this, Anand did not dare try out anything new. Then we saw this film ‘Back to the Future’. I don’t know if you have seen it, but it’s all about a time machine. Well, that was

![](images/d85aa02f70a05723e1ce453e850920ea8a2e577a32a31a0d088196cd41a47060.jpg)

![](images/c0b12e146fadf48841704bffd840580a0a7a900056f90207f1e6ca23fa17dcbd.jpg)

the end of peace and quiet in the house.

My brother decided that he had to make a time machine too. Papa locked up his tool box and hid the key while Ma kept a wary eye on her oven and mixer. Because, as I told you, when Anand is on one of his inventing binges, he takes apart all the gadgets in the house to collect parts. You can’t imagine the noise that

or heard

was going on—hammering and sawing and clattering. Anand’s room, next to our room, was transformed into a network of wires, springs, levers, and bulbs. There was an enormous panel which was to be control switchboard. As for Anand, he went around looking like a savage. When Ma didn’t notice, the fellow didn’t even comb his hair.

frantic: hurried and disorganised

Anand just wouldn’t let anyone into his room. Finally, after a fortnight of frantic activity, the time machine was ready. “We can try it out tonight,” Anand announced to everyone at home at lunch time.

“I don’t know what you’ve been up to in that room, but you’re not trying out anything new,” Papa said firmly.

crestfallen look: sad and disappointed appearance

“But it’s a time machine! I’ve invented it,” Anand protested.

“When I say NO, I mean NO,” Papa said, glaring.

“Poor boy,” Ma said noticing Anand’s crestfallen look.

“At least let’s take a look at it.”

Papa sighed. “All right, but if the house falls, it’s your fault.”

As it turned out, we could not try out the time machine that day at all. The next day, Papa and Ma were going to Kharagpur, a few hours away from Calcutta (now Kolkata), for a wedding. Ma was worried about leaving us alone, but we reassured her. “We’re old enough to look after ourselves, Ma,” I said. “And we can go next door to Sharma Aunty if we need anything.”

offended: felt upset or hurt

“And it’s only one night,” Anand added.

“All right. But promise me you won’t do anything with that time machine till we come back,” Ma said sternly, looking at Anand. He promised half-heartedly, offended at this lack of respect for his creation. I breathed a sigh of relief.

They left by the afternoon train and were coming back the following evening. Anand fell asleep immediately, but I stayed up to finish a novel. At about eleven thirty I thought I heard a scratching at the front door. Telling myself it was only my imagination, I went back to the book. A little later there was a rattle and a click. I was really scared, I can tell you, what with a murder story before me and then strange noises in the middle of the night! I shook Anand and whispered, “Listen, there’s someone at the door.”

“Go and open it then,” he muttered groggily.

“You silly! Someone’s trying to get in,” I said.

Anand sat up. “Who? What?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “What shall we do?”

groggily: sleepily

“Let’s holler for help,” he said. Before we could do anything, the door swung open and we found ourselves looking at a ruffianly fellow with a green scarf around his neck. Anand gasped.

“Hey, it’s Boppa!” I whispered. It was indeed the fellow who had recently begun sweeping out the compounds in our row of houses. So, he was the thief, and no wonder. He knew exactly when the occupants were out, leaving the coast clear.

The fellow gave an evil grin. “One squeak out of you and see what happens,” he said, brandishing his cudgel and backing out of the room. We heard him slide the latch in.

“What do we do now?” I asked in a low voice.

ruffianly: rough or violent looking

gasped: took a short, deep breath in surprise

brandishing: waving

cudgel: a short, thick stick used as a weapon

muffled: not a very clear and loud sound eerie: strange clattering: continuous loud noises

“Let’s shout anyway,” Anand suggested.

The door opened suddenly again in the middle of our discussion.

“No noise from you! Now, where is your father’s room?”

I was about to direct him upstairs when Anand said quickly, “The one next to this one.”

“You silly goose!” I said angrily as soon as the man had gone.

“That’s your room. He’ll come back as mad as mad can be.”

“At least it will give us some time to think of something,” Anand said. “He’ll take a while to locate the light switch. Let’s shout.” All of a sudden there was a crash followed by a loud scream. More strange noises emerged from the next room—a few muffled thumps, an eerie whine, and a low, humming sound.

“My time machine, he’s started it!” Anand gasped. “I wish we could get out of this room and see what is happening out there.”

There was another howl, much fainter this time, and a great deal of clattering. We shouted for all we were worth. In a few minutes, we heard footsteps running up our drive. Thankfully we recognised Mrs. Sharma’s voice, along with her husband and Dr. Mohan—also a neighbour.

“Anand! Anita! Children, what’s the matter? Where are you?”

“Here!” we shouted in unison. In a minute the door was unlocked.

unison: together

“What on earth has been happening here, children?” Sharma Uncle asked. Both Anand and I fell over ourselves trying to explain. “Where is the fellow now?”

“The last we heard, he was in the time machine,” I explained hastily, seeing everyone looking rather puzzled.

![](images/6598fc35c2c6559a2b63b92209e5a445d06a71a60f0fb9cdf54e537139fa5b14.jpg)

hastily: quickly

We entered the room cautiously and turned on the lights. The time machine was still humming softly but otherwise there was no other sound from the room.

“Well, where is he?” Dr. Mohan asked, peering behind the door. “Did you imagine this?”

peering: looking carefully

“Oh no,” I protested. “How could both of us have imagined the same thing?”

“Maybe he ran out,” Anand suggested.

“I’m sure we’d have seen him. There’s only one way out of this house and we came the same way as soon as we heard you,” Sharma Uncle sounded very sure.

“Look!” Anand said, pointing to the floor. “He was wearing that.” Near the panel of switches was the green scarf.

# indulgently: fondly

intruders: people who enter a place without permission dismantled: taken apart niggling: slight feeling (of )

“Let’s search the house—perhaps he’s still around,” Dr. Mohan said, going upstairs.

Boppa was nowhere to be seen. “Well maybe he did run out and we missed him,” Mrs. Sharma said at last, “I can’t imagine what else could have happened.”

“My time machine! He’s gone through that!” Anand burst out, his eyes shining.

“What an imagination this boy has!” Mr. Sharma said, smiling indulgently. “Now off to bed, both of you. I’ll spend the night here so you needn’t worry about any more intruders now.”

Needless to say, Boppa was never seen again. Anand insists that his time machine worked and he disappeared into the past. The machine itself was dismantled because Papa thought it wasn’t safe (maybe he also had a niggling suspicion that it worked), so we couldn’t try it out.

As for Anand, he is convinced that he is a genius and has launched a new project—something about a telephone to contact creatures in outer space. Tell you all about it next time.

# Let us learn

I Read the highlighted word in the following sentence.

It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens, this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging sound.

Such sound words are called onomatopoeic words.

Onomatopoeia is the use of words that imitate actual sounds of the thing they describe. The ‘boom’ of a firework exploding, the ‘ding-dong’ of a bell, the ‘pitter-patter’ of rain drops, the ‘tick-tock’ of a clock are all examples of onomatopoeia.

1. Read the sound words used in the story in Column 1. Complete Column 2 by matching expressions from the box given below. An example has been done for you.

II Read the highlighted phrase in the following sentence from the text.

Well, that was the end of peace and quiet in the house.

The highlighted phrase displays a combination of two words generally used together in a fixed order. Such phrases are called binomials.

Binomials are expressions consisting of two words, usually linked by a conjunction such as ‘and’ or ‘or’ that are commonly used together in a fixed order. The two words convey a single meaning or an opposite.

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running stream.

In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village where I live.

I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am.

I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.

I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting the white bulging sails.

I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!

When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.

The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading is their baskets full of dreams.

You won’t believe where I am!

I’m way up north, at the Thajiwas glacier in Kashmir. The glaciers are white and blue and we have to wear four layers of clothes. Appa and Amma love it here, and they like throwing snowballs at each other. But they say there was much more snow last year.

I also like the snow, but my hands are shaking from not wearing gloves, so I don’t think I can write any more.

Did you know that Arunachal Pradesh is far away from Himachal Pradesh? Himachal is in the north but Arunachal is all the way in the east. I thought all the Pradesh states sat next to each other.

We took two trains and drove a long time to get here. This morning, we walked through a forest to reach our treehouse. The forest here is so thick that if you blink or stop to tie your shoelaces, you will get lost.

I love Arunachal the best so far and am beginning to enjoy myself. I hope we get to see red pandas.

It did not take any time at all to travel south west and get to the Sundarbans in West Bengal. Today, Amma and Appa took me out onto the river in a small boat. Amma tells me that places like the Sundarbans are called wetlands. I never knew such a place existed, and that it was possible for trees called mangroves to grow in seawater! But Amma is sad about how much this place floods today.

We also saw crocodiles and a lonely snake while boating.   
I hope they don’t follow us home.

the sport of travelling down a river in an air-filled rubber boat

Dear class,

Today was the best day ever! We drove east from the desert to the Narmada river, which flows all the way to the centre of India, and it only took us six hours. In the afternoon, Amma, Appa, and I went rafting in the river and you won’t believe how wild and scary it was. I always thought rivers were calm, but up close they’re really fast. Appa says that there used to be a lot more water, and rafting was much scarier then.

I was fully wet by the time I was done, and Appa was so scared that he decided never to go rafting ever again. I love the water so much and can’t wait to go back.

Amma and Appa are fast asleep, and I should be sleeping too, but I just love looking out of the window. I think we’re in the southwest part of the country, in Goa, and you won’t believe how nice the plateaus look. There are so many hills here, and beaches too.

There are also a lot of tunnels that the train goes through. I used to be afraid of tunnels, but I’m not any more. Someday, I wish we could all go on a tour of the plateaus. Maybe when we’re in Class 11.

Love, Shaana

Dear friends,

I can’t believe we’re in the same state again! We travelled south, and I will be home soon.

We reached Chennai yesterday, and on the way to Puducherry, we decided to learn how to surf. I think I’m good at it now because I only fell down twice. Amma and Appa splashed water on each other and behaved like children. It’s a good thing I was there to control them.

The beaches here are not like the ones we have on our island. The waves are a lot rougher and the water is browner, but I still like it here.

Your best friend,

Shaana surf: (here) a water sport that involves standing on a long lightweight board and riding a wave to the seashore

Hi everyone,

I just crossed the Pamban bridge.

I could see the ocean on both sides. How amazing that a train can travel across the sea like this!

I’m almost home, and I can’t wait to give you my final letter in person.

Love,

Shaana

Dear classmates,

dive: (here) swim   
underwater with special breathing   
equipment; (past tense: dove)

pebbles: small, smooth stones

I thought Amma and Appa would be tired from all our travelling, but we made one last stop at the Olaikaadu beach before we reached home. And I’m so happy we did.

Amma wanted to teach me how to dive, but they did not have diving suits my size, so I spent the day floating and looking at the fish while my parents dove below me.

We found all sorts of pebbles on the beach, and I can’t wait to give them to you in person tomorrow.

Your best friend, Shaana

Dear Amma and Appa,

I can’t believe we travelled across the whole country! I know we’re going to miss visiting the forests, glaciers, deserts, wetlands, plateaus, and mountains. And we are going to miss hearing all those new languages and meeting all those different people. But we’re finally home now, and we can join our friends again.

I hope we get to travel like this again, and maybe next time we can take our friends with us.

With love, Shaana

# Let us think and reflect

I Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.

1. Amma tells me that places like the Sundarbans are called wetlands. I never knew such a place existed, and that it was possible for trees called mangroves to grow in seawater! But Amma is sad about how much this place floods today.

We also saw crocodiles and a lonely snake while boating. I hope they don’t follow us home.

How is everyone? Are you missing me yet?

(i) What feeling does Shaana most likely experience when she says, “I never knew such a place existed...”?

A. pride B. hope C. relief D. wonder (ii) Complete the following sentence with a suitable reason.

IV Read the following sentences from the text and underline the subject and the verb.

1. Amma and Appa are fast asleep. (When the subject of a sentence has two or more nouns or pronouns that are connected by ‘and’, we use a plural verb).   
2. It’s hot, dry, and there is sand everywhere. (In case the subject is ‘it’, the verb that follows is either ‘is’ or ‘was’ depending on the tense of the sentence).   
3. There are so many hills here, and beaches too. (When we begin a sentence with ‘there’, the subject comes after the verb).

The subject of a sentence is closely linked to the verb. The verb form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and if it is in the third person. Choosing the correct verb based on the subject is called subject-verb agreement.

Let us understand subject-verb agreement better.

• A subject and its verb must agree, even if other words or phrases come between them. The formation of paragraphs is important in writing.   
• When the subjects are considered individually, we use a singular verb. Every man and woman has the right to vote.   
• Collective nouns such as ‘class’, ‘committee’, ‘audience’, ‘team’ can be singular or plural, based on the context of the sentence. If the sentence implies the group is acting as one unit, the noun is singular and takes a singular verb. The committee decides on the new policy tomorrow.   
• The indefinite pronouns ‘each’, ‘either’, ‘every’, ‘much’, and ‘neither’   
always require singular verbs. Each of the children was given a gift.   
• Subjects that look plural because they end in ‘s’ but refer to one thing are singular. Mathematics is an interesting subject.   
• Some nouns (like glasses, scissors, pants, and tongs) are plural but take a singular verb when the phrase ‘pair of’ is placed before it. Here, ‘pair’ is the subject. This pair of scissors is sharp.

• When subjects are joined by ‘or’ or ‘nor’, the verb should match the subject that is closer to it.

3 Neither the students nor the teacher wants to cancel the trip. 3 Either the manager or the employees are responsible for the mistake.

V Choose the correct option from the words given in the brackets.

1. A pair of sunglasses (is/are) essential when travelling to sunny destinations.   
2. Either the tour guide or the tourists (has/have) to arrive first at the meeting point.   
3. The information on travel expenses (is/are) useful for firsttime travellers.   
4. Neither the flight crew nor the pilot (was/were) aware of the delay.   
5. The news about the heavy rains (makes/make) many people reconsider their vacation plans.   
6. A pair of binoculars (is/are) useful for spotting wildlife on a safari.   
7. The hill stations in India (remains/remain) a popular travel destination during winter.   
8. Keeping accounts (is/are) important for spending money wisely during travel.   
9. Either the ticket or the bus passes (need/needs) to be used for travelling in the tourist bus.   
10. Neither the passengers nor the taxi driver (was/were) aware of the best route to the hotel.

Tob y : Thank you, Anita!

Ani ta : Er... could you tell me something more about yourself?

Tob y : Why not! What do you want to know about me, Anita?

Ani ta : What do you eat for breakfast?

Tob y : Well, we Martians don’t need to eat anything. We get our energy from the Sun.

Ani ta : Oh! Don’t you ever feel like having ice creams and chocolates? I can’t think of life without them!

Tob y : No, Anita! We are made of different stuff.

Ani ta : Okay, tell me one thing. How are you able to see with only one eye? I see only one big eye in the centre of your face.

Tob y : My friend, we Martians need only one eye to see clearly. In fact, I can see even with my eye closed. I can see beyond mountains and clouds, wood and even metals. I can see that you are carrying a toy in your pocket. It’s a blue aeroplane. Isn’t it? And yes! That apple you just had for breakfast is going round-and-round in your stomach right now!

You will listen to a conversation between a girl and her father about the art of paper folding called origami. As you listen, select the true statements from 1–7.

Father : Sai dear! What are you working on there with all that paper?

Sai : Baba, I am trying to make an origami crane, but it’s a bit tricky. I keep messing up the folds.

Father : Ah, origami! I remember doing that when I was your age. You know, Sai, origami has a really interesting history.

Sai : Really? I thought it was just something fun to do with paper.

Father : It is fun, but it’s also an age-old art form. Origami started in Japan over a thousand years ago. Back then, paper was really expensive, so it was only used for special occasions, like religious ceremonies.

Sai : Wow, I didn’t know that. So, it wasn’t just for doing crafts?

Father : It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that people began making animals, flowers and other designs just for fun.

Sai : So, people have been making paper cranes for hundreds of years?

Father : Yes, and the crane is especially important in Japanese culture. It’s a symbol of peace and long life. There’s even a belief that if you fold a thousand paper cranes, you can make a wish, and it will come true.

Sai : A thousand cranes? That’s a lot! But it sounds like a really nice tradition.

Father : It is. Origami isn’t just about the final shape—it’s about the process, the patience and the creativity involved. And over the years, it’s spread all over the world, with people adding their own styles and techniques.

Sai : I had no idea origami had such a long history. It makes folding this crane feel even more special.

Father : I’m glad you think so, Sai. Perhaps we can start with something simpler next time. How about we make an origami paper boat next? It’s easier, and we can float it in the stream outside.

Sai : A boat sounds awesome! Let’s do it! But first, I want to finish this crane. Can you help me with the last few steps?

Father : Of course! Let’s finish this crane together. After that, we’ll sail our paper boat.

You will listen to a girl speak about the story of how Agartala got its name and the importance of agar. As you listen, choose the correct option for the questions given below.

Hi everyone,

We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you know how Agartala got its name? It’s made up of two words: ‘agar’, which is a type of tree, and ‘tala’, meaning underneath. So, Agartala means ‘under the agar tree’. These trees are also called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred to as ‘wood of the gods’.

Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells amazing—like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas. The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago.

Here’s something even more remarkable—agarwood only forms when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance called agar oil which protects it from further infection.

Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It’s used to make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura is famous for.

And here’s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost every house in northern Tripura. How great is that!

# shimmered:

shined with a light that appears to move

railway embankment: a stone wall made to carry the railway over low ground

# cutting: a

narrow valley cut through a hill to make space for a railway line scrub-covered: covered with short trees and bushes

It was almost noon, and the jungle was very still, very silent. Heat waves shimmered along the railway embankment where it cut a path through the tall evergreen trees. The railway lines were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel in the hillside.

Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the midday train. It wasn’t a station, and he wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting so that he could watch the steam engine come roaring out of the tunnel.

He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until he had come to a small village. He had left the cycle there, and walked over a low scrub-covered hill and down to the tunnel exit.

Now he looked up. He had heard, in the distance, the shrill whistle of the engine. He couldn’t see anything, because the train was approaching from the other side of the hill;

but presently a sound like distant thunder issued from the tunnel, and he knew the train was coming through.

![](images/cfc6cb268c4acbd966777421a37088060b2499da2d11ed1f8a006b980e44281f.jpg)

A second or two later, the steam engine shot out of the tunnel, snorting and puffing like some green, black, and gold dragon, some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams. Showering sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle.

Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. Waves of hot steam struck him in the face. Even the trees seemed to flinch from the noise and heat. And then the train had gone, leaving only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over the tall shisham trees.

The jungle was still again. No one moved.

Suraj turned from his contemplation of the drifting smoke and began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel.

The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When he had gone about twenty yards, it became pitch dark. Suraj had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure himself that there was still daylight outside. Ahead of him, the tunnel’s other opening was just a small round circle of light.

The tunnel was still full of smoke from the train, but it would be several hours before another train came through. Till then, the cutting belonged to the jungle again.

# instinctively:

without thought or plan

shisham: a tree found in northern parts of India

contemplation: deep thought reassure: comfort, calm scuttled: ran hurriedly

dazzled: blinded by bright light swishing: moving with a brushing sound

Suraj didn’t stop, because there was nothing to do in the tunnel and nothing to see. He had simply wanted to walk through, so that he would know what the inside of a tunnel was really like. The walls were damp and sticky. A bat flew past. A lizard scuttled between the lines.

Coming straight from the darkness into the light, Suraj was dazzled by the sudden glare and put a hand up to shade his eyes. He looked up at the tree-covered hillside and thought he saw something moving between the trees.

![](images/4971a3d392ed3fe77ee5742d06d5949e1c34de5b894fb50c22c99bafe6b6e3c3.jpg)

It was just a flash of orange and gold, and a long swishing tail. It was there between the trees for a second or two, and then it was gone.

About fifteen metres from the entrance to the tunnel stood the watchman’s hut. Marigolds grew in front of the hut, and at the back there was a small vegetable patch. It was the watchman’s duty to inspect the tunnel and keep it clear of obstacles.

Every day, before the train came through, he would walk the length of the tunnel. If all was well, he would

obstacles: things that block the way porcupine: a small animal (large rodent) with sharp spikes on its back

return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag, and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of course, he would not stop the train if there was a porcupine on the line. But if there was any danger to the train, he’d go back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine. If all was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of his hut and go to sleep.

He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap when he saw the boy emerge from the tunnel. He waited until Suraj was only a metre or so away and then said, “Welcome, welcome. I don’t often have visitors. Sit down for a while, and tell me why you were inspecting my tunnel.”

“Is it your tunnel?” asked Suraj.

![](images/fd2c5a6bc636664ce8f88f1a57096ad245f214b9d1b0337608045ce881097978.jpg)

“It is,” said the watchman. “It is truly my tunnel, since no one else will have anything to do with it. I have only lent it to the Government.”

Suraj sat down on the edge of the cot.

“I wanted to see the train come through,” he said. “And then, when it had gone, I thought I’d walk through the tunnel.”

“And what did you find in it?”

“Nothing. It was very dark. But when I came out, I thought I saw an animal—up on the hill—but I’m not sure, it moved off very quickly.”

“It was a leopard you saw,” said the watchman. “My leopard.”

“Do you own a leopard too?”

“I do.”

“And do you lend it to the Government?”

“I do not.”

“Is it dangerous?”

“No, it’s a leopard that minds its own business. It comes to this range for a few days every month.”

“Have you been here a long time?” asked Suraj.

“Many years. My name is Sunder Singh.”

“My name’s Suraj.”

“There is one train during the day. And there is one train during the night. Have you seen the night mail come through the tunnel?”

“No. At what time does it come?”

“About nine o’clock, if it isn’t late. You could come and sit here with me, if you like. And after it has gone, instead of going to sleep I will take you home.”

“I’ll ask my parents,” said Suraj. “Will it be safe?”

“Of course. It is safer in the jungle than in the town. Nothing happens to me out here. But last month, when I went into town, I was almost run over by a bus.”

Sunder Singh yawned and stretched himself out on the cot. “And now I am going to take a nap, my friend. It is too hot to be up and about in the afternoon.”

“Everyone goes to sleep in the afternoon,” complained Suraj. “My father lies down as soon as he’s had his lunch.”

“Well, the animals also rest in the heat of the day. It is only the tribe of boys who cannot, or will not, rest.”

Sunder Singh placed a large banana leaf over his face to keep away the flies, and was soon snoring gently. Suraj stood up, looking up and down the railway tracks. Then he began walking back to the village.

# II

The following evening, towards dusk, as the flying foxes swooped silently out of the trees, Suraj made his way to the watchman’s hut.

It had been a long hot day, but now the earth was cooling, and a light breeze was moving through the trees. It carried with it the scent of mango blossoms, the promise of rain.

# swooped:

moved quickly through the air downwards

Sunder Singh was waiting for Suraj. He had watered his small garden, and the flowers looked cool and fresh. A kettle was boiling on a small oil stove.

“I am making tea,” he said. “There is nothing like a glass of hot tea while waiting for a train.”

They drank their tea, listening to the sharp notes of the tailorbird and the noisy chatter of the seven sisters.

seven sisters: birds, also called jungle babblers and found in groups of six to eight

![](images/aba2adfb81742eb50b5ce0cfffb4cd8a036d20f63a54887d02a6e5e2945019d9.jpg)

As the brief twilight faded, most of the birds fell silent. Sunder Singh lit his oil lamp and said it was time for him to inspect the tunnel. He moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the trees seemed to move closer to him. And the nightlife of the forest was conveyed on the breeze—the sharp call of a barking deer, the cry of a fox, the quaint tonk-tonk of a nightjar. There were some sounds that Suraj didn’t recognise—sounds that came from the trees, creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming to life, stretching their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, flexing their fingers.

quaint: unusual nightjar: a nocturnal bird with a short bill flexing: bending

# trimming:

(here) adjusting the wick of the lamp

Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp. The night sounds were familiar to him and he did not give them much thought; but something else—a padded footfall, a rustle of dry leaves—made him stand still for a few seconds, peering into the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he returned to where Suraj was waiting. Ten minutes remained for the night mail to arrive.

As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound reached both of them quite distinctly—a rhythmic sawing sound, as if someone cutting through the branch of a tree.

“What’s that?” whispered Suraj.

“It’s the leopard,” said Sunder Singh. “I think it’s in the tunnel.”

“The train will soon be here,” said Suraj.

“Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the tunnel, it will be run over and killed. I can’t let that happen.”

“But won’t it attack us if we try to drive it out?” asked Suraj, beginning to share the watchman’s concern.

“Not this leopard. It knows me well. We have seen each other many times. It has a weakness for goats and stray dogs, but it will not harm us. Even so, I’ll take my axe with me. You stay here, Suraj.”

“No, I’m coming with you. It will be better than sitting here alone in the dark!”

“All right, but stay close behind me. And remember, there is nothing to fear.”

Raising his lamp, Sunder Singh advanced into the tunnel, shouting at the top of his voice to try and scare away the animal. Suraj followed close behind, but he found he was unable to do any shouting. His throat was quite dry.

![](images/cae0911bd64880a7849b572b858b4964f4fb4f4068fb59b014a8f9d031cd2258.jpg)

They had gone about twenty paces into the tunnel when the light from the lamp fell upon the leopard. It was crouching between the tracks, only five metres away from them. It was not a very big leopard, but it looked lithe and sinewy. Baring its teeth and snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching.

Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices rang through the tunnel. And the leopard, uncertain as to how many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel with him, turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness.

To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked the length of the tunnel. When they returned to the entrance, the rails were beginning to hum. They knew the train was coming.

lithe: thin, graceful sinewy: lean and muscular snarling: growling twitching: a short, sudden movement

Suraj put his hand to one of the rails and felt its tremor. He heard the distant rumble of the train. And then the engine came round the bend, hissing at them, scattering sparks into the darkness, defying the jungle as it roared through the steep

defying: opposing

sides of the cutting. It charged straight at the tunnel, and into it, thundering past Suraj like the beautiful dragon of his dreams.

And when it had gone, the silence returned and the forest seemed to breathe, to live again. Only the rails still trembled with the passing of the train.

They trembled again to the passing of the same train, almost a week later, when Suraj and his father were both travelling in it.

Suraj’s father was scribbling in a notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat at an open window staring out at the darkness. His father was going to Delhi on a business trip and $\setminus$ had decided to take the boy along. (“I don’t know where he gets to, most of the time,” he’d complained. “I think it’s time he learnt something about my business.”)

flickering: burning unsteadily fringe: edge shrill: sharp sound

The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of passengers. The carriage wheels beat out a steady rhythm on the rails. Tiny flickering lights came and went, as they passed small villages on the fringe of the jungle.

Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge. It was too dark to see the hut near the cutting, but he knew they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his eyes looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out a shrill whistle, Suraj saw the lamp.

He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he knew that his friend was out there.

The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle behind and thundered across the endless plains.

Suraj stared out at the darkness, thinking of the lonely cutting in the forest and the watchman with the lamp, who would always remain a firefly for those travelling thousands as he lit up the darkness for steam engines and leopards.

3. When the wind blew, I heard the of the wooden roof.   
4. He heard a of leaves behind him when he was walking in the woods.   
5. I get disturbed by the continuous of the monkeys in the neighbourhood.

III Read what the watchman Sunder Singh did regularly at the tunnel as part of his duty. Notice the use of ‘would’.

Every day, before the train came through, he would walk the length of the tunnel. If all was well, he would return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel.

![](images/2874b8e4969e9a4ebfadf23faf8ae43588c54299cd2749af3c6bf0a414f7f391.jpg)

1. Why is the word ‘would’ used here?

(i) to make a polite request (ii) to express a desire (iii) to talk about a habit in the past

In these sentences, the word ‘would’ is used to speak about a past habit.

‘Would’ is used in these sentences to describe repeated activities for a period of time in the past. We call them ‘habitual or routine actions in the past’.

Would and used to both describe something that happened regularly in the past. However, ‘used to’ indicates a past action that doesn’t happen any longer.

• I used to paint when I was in Grade 4. • Riya used to eat a lot of junk food, but she stopped last year. 2. Complete the sentences using the verb in brackets with the correct form of ‘used to’ or ‘would’. An example has been done for you.

When I was a child we used to live in a village near a forest. Back then, we (i) (grow) vegetables in our back garden. Every day we (ii) (get up) early and go for a walk. The weather in summer (iii) (be) really nice. There was a lake near the house and we (iv) (go) there every Sunday for a picnic. Winters (v) (be) rather cold. In the evenings, my father (vi) (tell) us incredible stories and we (vii) (listen) with admiration.

IV We use punctuation marks to make our writing clear. You already know how to use full stops and commas. Let us look at three more punctuation marks—brackets, semicolon, and colon.

Colon (:) is used to introduce a list or an explanation.

• You need the following ingredients to make Ela Ada: ghee, coconut, jaggery, and rice flour.   
• He has one goal: to win the championship.

Semicolon (;) is used to connect two clauses which are closely related without a conjunction.

• She loves reading; he prefers watching movies.   
• Suraj followed close behind; but he found he was unable to do any shouting.

Now, use semicolons and colons to punctuate the following paragraph.

We explored the busy by-lanes of Charminar, the heart of Hyderabad it was an exciting day. We wanted to do a few things buy bangles, taste biryani, and purchase pearl earrings, which are special to this area. As we walked through the lanes, we saw stalls selling spices, clothes, and jewellery the market was full of colours. We visited some famous spots Charminar, Golconda Fort, Salar Jung Museum, and Chowmahalla Palace each place was beautiful.

The railroad track is miles away, And the day is loud with voices speaking, Yet there isn’t a train goes by all day

But I hear its whistle shrieking.

All night there isn’t a train goes by, Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,

But I see its cinders red on the sky,

And hear its engine steaming.

My heart is warm with the friends I make, And better friends I’ll not be knowing; Yet there isn’t a train I wouldn’t take, No matter where it’s going.

# Let us speak

When speaking in English, small differences in pronunciation can change the overall meaning of the words. One such difference is in the pronunciation of the consonant ‘c’.

For example: cat (uses $/ \mathbf { k } /$ sound for $\mathbf { \bar { c } } _ { } ^ { \prime }$ ) and city (uses the $/ \mathrm { s } /$ sound for $\mathbf { \epsilon } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { c } ^ { \prime }$ )

The poem uses the word ‘cinders’, which is pronounced with a $/ \mathsf { s } /$ sound.

The letter ‘c’ has two sounds. It can be pronounced as a $/ \mathrm { k } /$ or $/ \mathrm { s } /$ sound.   
But which is right depends on the next letters of the words.

• Letter ‘c’ produces $/ \mathrm { s } /$ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’, or ‘y’. For example, city ( $\mathbf { \epsilon } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { c } ^ { \prime }$ is followed by ‘i’). This $/ \mathrm { s } /$ sound is known as the soft $\cdot _ { \mathrm { c } } \cdot $ sound. • Letter ‘c’ produces $/ \mathbf { k } /$ sound if it is followed by the letters $\mathbf { \acute { a } }$ , ‘o’, or ‘u’ or a consonant at the end of the word. For example, cat (‘c’ is followed by ‘a’). This $/ \mathbf { k } /$ sound is known as the hard ‘c’ sound.

That is why ‘cinders’ is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ is followed by ‘i’!

Now, work in pairs. Pronounce the given words aloud. Keep the rules of the soft and hard ‘c’ pronunciation in mind.

# Let us read

This is a story that narrates the triumph of will, courage, determination, and dedication. Arunima Sinha’s journey from a devastating accident to scaling the highest peak in the world stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. In 2011, at the age of 24, Arunima Sinha, a national-level volleyball player, faced a life-altering event. It challenged her in ways she could never have imagined. As she lay in the hospital bed with one leg amputated, Arunima made a vow that many would deem impossible: not only to walk again with a prosthetic leg but to scale Mount Everest. In 2013, she did just that, becoming the first Indian female amputee to achieve this feat. Hence, in 2015, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. She was also awarded the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and National Award for Best Female Mountaineer.

Arunima hails from Ambedkar Nagar, a small district in Uttar Pradesh. Her father was an army engineer, and her mother worked as a health supervisor. Sports were a significant part of Arunima’s life, with her family having a natural inclination towards athletics. After completing her law degree following her post-graduation, Arunima decided to pursue a job in the paramilitary forces, which would allow her to continue her passion for sports while having a regular income.

On the fateful night of 11 April 2011, she met with a train accident. The hours that followed were harrowing. She never imagined she would survive that night, but survive she did, miraculously, displaying an extraordinary will to live. Arunima received a prosthetic leg and underwent physiotherapy. It was during this period that she made a profound decision. Inspired by an article about Mount Everest, she resolved to conquer the highest peak in the world.

To pursue her ambition, Arunima Sinha completed a basic mountaineering course at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, followed by eighteen months of rigorous training. Arunima approached Bachendri Pal, the

first Indian woman to summit Everest, to guide her in the endeavour. Bachendri Pal instilled confidence in Arunima and said, “My child, you decided to climb Mount Everest in these situations with a prosthetic leg—you have conquered the Everest within you; the world will realise it later.”

On 21 May 2013, after 52 exhausting days, Arunima Sinha reached the summit of Mount Everest. Standing at the top of the world, she felt a surge of emotions—pride, relief, and an overwhelming sense of achievement. She displayed the Indian flag at the summit and left behind a photograph of her idol, Swami Vivekananda, whose teachings had inspired her throughout her journey.

Arunima’s feat did not end with Everest. By July 2016, she had summited seven peaks in Europe, Africa, Australia,

South America, North America, and of course, Mount Everest in Asia. In January 2019, she climbed the seventh peak on Antarctica and became world’s first female amputee to climb Mount Vinson. Her goal to complete the Seven Summits was achieved.

Throughout her journey, Arunima   
has faced numerous challenges and   
setbacks. Yet, her story is not just about physical endurance but also about mental

fortitude and the power of a positive mind set. Her message is simple yet profound: “Never give up and work hard. Always remember your goal and work on it.”

Arunima’s autobiography, Born Again on the Mountain: A Story of Losing Everything and Finding It Back records her incredible journey to the top of the world. It is a story of triumph over adversity, a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to rise above the most challenging circumstances.

She was conferred with the honorary doctorate by the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. In her words, “Failure is not when we fall short of achieving our goals. It is when we don’t have goals worthy enough. Never forget your goal, respect it, work hard, and you will be the winner.” Dr. Arunima Sinha has not only conquered mountains but has also won people’s hearts the world over, inspiring them to reach their own summits.

1. Listen to this announcement made in the morning assembly about a school trip to the National Science Centre. As you listen, circle the words that are not correct.

Good morning students!

I have some very exciting news to share with you all. The muchawaited educational trip to the National Science Centre will be held on 16 September, that is in two weeks! As you know this would be a fantastic opportunity to explore and learn more about the world around us.

We will be starting from school at 8.00 in the morning and return by 5.30 in the evening. All of you must be in proper school uniform. Don’t forget to carry your identity cards. Light refreshments will be provided at the museum. But do carry a water bottle and a packed lunch. You are not permitted to wear any jewellery or carry mobile phones. You may carry a notebook and a pen to make notes. Interested students must bring a permission slip signed by your parent and submit them to their class teachers by 10 September. It is going to be a fun trip so don’t miss out. If you have any more questions, please contact Mr. Mukherjee, the excursion in-charge.

2. Now, listen to the announcement again and rectify the sentences.

You will listen to five speakers share their opinion about adventure sports. As you listen match the statements 1–8 with the speakers (i)–(v). There are three extra statements that you do not need.

Speaker (i): As a parent, I fear the risks involved, especially with activities like rock climbing or paragliding.

I’m quite worried about the safety risks of adventure sports. It’s important to consider these risks before letting children participate.

Speaker (ii): Adventure sports are thrilling! All my friends agree; it is amazing. It’s not just about fun; it’s about pushing your limits and experiencing something new. I think it’s worth trying, of course, with a trainer.

Speaker (iii): As organisers of adventure camps, we take safety very seriously. Our team ensures all equipment is regularly checked and maintained. Participants are given thorough training and are always supervised by professionals. We focus on minimising risks while still providing an exciting experience.

Speaker (iv): At our school, we organise adventure camps with activities like trekking and zip-lining. However, we stick to basic sports that are safe and manageable for students. We always prioritise safety, ensuring that all necessary precautions and measures are in place. Being careful is what we promote.

Speaker (v): In my opinion, sports should be about fitness and enjoyment, like track and field or swimming. Why risk your life for a fleeting moment of thrill just for a feeling of adventure? Traditional sports are safer and just as fulfilling!

territorial integrity: safeguarding nation’s borders

House No…   
Jayanagar   
Bengaluru   
14 April 20XX   
Dear Ananda,   
Hope you are all doing well!

Do you remember our last conversation about war and the importance of peace? We talked about how India had to struggle for its Independence from the British for many centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their lives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember anything about them?

Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit to many places of historical and educational significance. I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited to share them with you.

envisioned: visualised

Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument that I found most inspiring. Let’s see if you can guess. The construction of this monument started in April 2018 and was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in February 2019. In terms of location and size, it is spread over 40 acres of land near the iconic India Gate. But more importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I’m sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National War Memorial’. Won’t you say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled?

Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country even after our Independence in 1947.

This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the IndoPak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen soldiers have been etched.

iconic: celebrated tribute: showing respect, gratitude etched: engraved

It was heartening to know that our government has recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India’s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC).

Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the IndiaChina Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965. Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.

In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were awarded the PVC (posthumously) include Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, and Major Hoshiar Singh. Some Navy personnel

gallantry: exceptional courage especially in battle

posthumously: after death

# citation:

including Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also awarded MVC for their exemplary courage and leadership.

Then the teacher shared with us the citation of Param Vir Chakra awardee Lance Naik Albert Ekka. It touched my heart and also motivated me. We were awestruck and humbled by his bravery. I aspire to be courageous like him when I join the army!

Lance Naik Albert Ekka (PVC)

# Cita tion

Lance Naik Albert Ekka, (No. 4239746), 14 Guards

Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward company of a Battalion of the Brigade of Guards during their attack on the enemy defence at Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a well-fortified position held in strength by the enemy. The assaulting troops were subjected to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire, but they charged on to the objective and were locked in bitter hand-to-hand combat. Lance Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light Machine Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his company. With complete disregard to his personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker, bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the Light Machine Gun. Though seriously wounded in this encounter, he continued to fight alongside his comrades through the mile deep objective, clearing bunker after bunker with undaunted courage. Towards the northern end of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine Gun opened up from the second storey of a well-fortified building inflicting heavy casualties and holding up the attack. Once again, this gallant soldier without worrying about his personal safety, despite his serious injury and the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward till he reached the building and lobbed a grenade through the loophole of the bunker, killing one enemy and injuring the other.

The Medium Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With outstanding courage and grim determination, Lance Naik Albert Ekka scaled a side wall and entering the bunker, bayoneted the enemy who was still firing and thus silenced the Machine Gun, saving further casualties to his company and ensured the success of the attack.

In this process, however, he received serious injuries and succumbed to them after the capture of the objective. In this action, Lance Naik Albert Ekka displayed the most conspicuous valour, determination and made the supreme sacrifice in the best traditions of the Army. (Gazette of India Notification No. 7– Pres./72)

As we continued our visit around the National War Memorial, we came across another important installation called Amar Jawan Jyoti that commemorates our soldiers. The name, as you may have guessed, represents an immortal flame that is kept ablaze all through the day and night to revere the sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which also displayed a rifle and a helmet, was alighted under the arch of India Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India’s victory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971.

# commemorates:

remember officially and show respect

The National War Memorial now includes Amar Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk, which is surrounded by four Chakras. During the inauguration, the Prime Minister lit a new flame to commemorate the fallen heroes. Later, the old flame at India Gate was also merged with the new flame at the National War Memorial. Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan Jyoti if you haven’t seen it.

You can see the obelisk surrounded by wreaths that have been placed as a mark of respect. The lighting design is planned in such a way that it transforms the monument’s landscape as sunlight changes from dawn to dusk. It truly is a majestic site that filled me with pride for our nation. I was also overwhelmed by the interminable flame as a metaphor for eternal stories of courage and valour.

# wreaths:

Our teacher also explained the significance of the Chakras to us. I found it interesting and hence I am sharing with you.

The National War Memorial consists of four concentric circles, which are known as Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra, and Raksha Chakra around a 15-metre-tall central obelisk with the eternal flame—the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It also houses bronze and stone murals and graphic panels. Isn’t it amazing!

murals: large paintings on a wall

The innermost circle represents the Amar Chakra, also known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’. This has the Obelisk with Eternal Flame. The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the assurance that the nation will never forget their sacrifice.

The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra, which is also known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’. There is a covered gallery that exhibits six murals crafted in bronze, depicting valiant battle actions of our Armed Forces.

The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra, also known as the ‘Circle of Sacrifice’. The circular concentric walls of honour symbolise the ancient war formation, which is called Chakravyuh. The walls are covered with granite tablets and individual tablet is solely dedicated to each fallen hero of postIndependent India. Their names are etched in golden letters.

![](images/fe252d0653ee96f4b916e6f8dda317ffb191e89bad5f9da6a492ef0aee3e5293.jpg)

The outermost circle represents the Raksha Chakra, which is also known as the ‘Circle of Protection’. In this chakra the row of trees is a reassurance to the citizens of the country about their safety against any threat. Each tree represents the soldiers who ensure the territorial integrity of the nation.

We spent the whole day, from morning to evening, at the National War Memorial and the surrounding areas, marked by majestic lawns and grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were immersed in the ambience that was solemn and a reminder of what a free nation could achieve. The overall environment created an emotive experience that was visually inspiring. I felt as if I had developed a bond with the place.

I learnt a lot, but I also have to admit that the various discourses during the day brought tears to my eyes. It was sad to think about the massive devastation and loss of life caused by wars. It motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices of our heroes.

# discourses:

serious discussions on different topics

After our visit, the class decided to make presentations on stories of valour of the bravehearts we came across at the National War Memorial. We divided ourselves into five groups. We decided to make presentations depicting the courageous stories of the soldiers. Our teacher has also advised us to share our experience during the school assembly. I am delighted that all the students of our school will get to know about the National War Memorial and the soldiers it commemorates.

I am going to give a presentation on the story of Major Padmapani Acharya, who fought for India in the 1999 Kargil War and was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.

# The citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as follows:

Gazette Notification : 17 Pres/2000,15.8.99 Op eration : Op Vijay- Karg il Date of Award : 15 Aug 1999

Citation Major Padm ap an i Acharya (IC -55072) 2 Rajp utan a Rifles (Posthum ous)

On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya as a Company Commander, was assigned the formidable task of capturing an enemy position which was heavily fortified, strongly held and covered with mines and sweeping machine gun and artillery fire.

Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at the very beginning when the enemy’s artillery fire came down squarely on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties.

With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up the steep rock face with his reserve platoon.

Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy’s position, Major Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured. Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was captured.

After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his injuries.

Major Padmapani Acharya displayed exceptional courage, leadership and spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his father that he wasn’t afraid or scared about losing his life while trying to protect the motherland. Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita he went on to say:

हतोो वाा प्रााप्‍स्यसि� स्‍‍वर्गंं जि�त्‍वाा वाा भोोक्ष्‍यसे े मही ीम् ।् तस्‍‍मा ादुत्तिु �ष्‍ठ कौौन्‍‍ते ेय यु द्धााय ु कृ ृ तनि�श्‍चय:।।2.37।।

Hato vā prāpsyasi svargaṃ jitvā vā bhokṣyase mahim Tasmāduttiṣṭha kaunteya yuddhāya kṛtaniścayaḥ

If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go to the celestial abode, or you will gain victory and enjoy the kingdom on the earth. Therefore, arise O, son of Kunti! Be determined to fight.

24 April 20XX

Dear Soumya,

It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I enjoyed reading your experience of the visit to the National War Memorial in Delhi, as well as your observations and feelings during the visit. You really have an eye for detail, and being the sensitive person that you are, you have been able to capture the essence of the emotions associated with this memorial.

I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity to visit the National War Memorial. I have heard a lot about it. Some people might see a war memorial as just a monument, statue, an edifice to celebrate our war heroes or victory and commemorate those who lost their lives or got injured in the war. In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to serve my motherland.

I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn about India’s heroes and also pay your respect to them. The idea of your class to make a presentation at the school and make everyone a part of your experience is wonderful! Best of luck for your presentation, I hope it goes well and motivates the school students to join the Indian Armed Forces.

Your letter has reminded me of a time when we visited the war memorial in our city. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens, we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 3. As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War Memorial located in the heart of the garden.

When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the following poem:

# P ushp ki Abh ilasha

I hope you like the poem. I must say, I was inspired by your idea of presenting the valourous stories of India’s soldiers. There are so many stories of courage, bravery and sacrifice which remind us that many of the challenges we face in our lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace in our country and the luxury of exchanging ideas with our friends because our Armed Forces are alert and work hard to create that environment for us.

Captain Anuj Nayyar, MahaVir Chakra

Very recently, I read in the newspaper that Captain Anuj Nayyar, MVC, an Indian Army officer of the 17 Jat regiment was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India’s second highest gallantry award, for exemplary valour during the Kargil War in 1999. I look forward to learning more about him. Meanwhile, I learnt that his mother Meena Nayyar has written a memoir titled Tiger of Drass– Capt. Anuj Nayyar – 23 – Kargil Hero, which I shall certainly go through. I am sharing with you an excerpt of her interview with IANS.

“Writing about the smallest things about your child who is not with you really used to shake me, but gradually I came to terms with it by telling myself that if I didn’t write about him no one would know about Anuj’s sacrifice.”

Our flag does not fly because the wind moves it, it fllies with the last breath of each soldier who died protecting it.

I have shared your experience with many of my friends. We all wish to visit the National War Memorial, Delhi. We have found out a mobile app ‘National War Memorial and Museum’. This app is very interactive and provides answers to our queries in 21 languages. The murals on the walls are enchanting. A great learning experience indeed!

Next week, I am going to share this idea with my classmates and my teacher. I think it would be great to create a collage capturing the lives and stories of people that can inspire us each day.

I know that we can email each other. I really like to receive letters from you, not just because of the ideas that you share but also because the envelope of your letters often comes with beautiful stamps, which make me happy. I don’t know if I ever shared it before, but collecting stamps is one of my favourite hobbies. I’ve been doing it for years. But I learnt recently that the act of collecting stamps is called ‘philately’. This time I received a stamp that celebrates India’s independence, a theme related to your letter.

Okay, that’s all from me for now. But before I conclude, guess what we had for breakfast! Fluffy idlis and we all remembered you. Give my regards to your parents.

I am inspired by your letter!

Hope to hear from you soon about your new adventures and experiences.

Best wishes, Ananda

Study the following words taken from the text.

disregard, inconsequential, immortal, undaunted

These words are made by adding word beginnings like dis-, in-, im- and unto the root words regard, consequence, mortal, and daunt respectively. Such word beginnings are called prefixes.

• dis- $^ +$ regard • in- $^ { \cdot + }$ consequential • im-+mortal • un-+daunted

# Homa ge to Ou r Bra ve Soldiers

# Let us listen (refer to page 196)

You will listen to a girl speak about why she wishes to join the Armed Forces when she grows up. As you listen, answer the questions given below in two–three exact words you hear.

Good morning, respected teachers and my dear friends.

Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up.

Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have. It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means risking one’s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a strong desire to serve India.

The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally, regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly admire and wish to achieve.

Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches loyalty, duty, service, and honesty.

This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces.

Thank you.

I Think and complete the poem titled ‘A Soldier’s Pride’.

II Now, listen to the poem and correct your answers wherever required.

In fields so vast, our soldiers stand, With hearts so brave, and firm command, They guard our land both night and day, To keep our fears and foes at bay.

With every dawn and setting sun, Their duty calls, it must be done, Through stormy skies and blazing heat, They march along with steady feet.

For love of land, they fight and strive, To keep our hopes and dreams alive, With pride and honour, they defend, Our India, till the very end.

You will listen to the teacher speak about a braveheart. As you listen, complete the bio-table given below.

Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her name is Rani Gaidinliu.

Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as the Kabui tribe.

In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement. This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending British rule.

Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between 1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the Northeast.

After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described Gaidinliu as the ‘Daughter of the Hills’ and gave her the title ‘Rani’ for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1982.

In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously.

The State Government has developed a park along with a statue to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996 and a commemorative coin in 2015.

What a braveheart indeed!
